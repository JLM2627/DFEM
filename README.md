# Desserts For Every Mood



## Synopsis

This project is an app in which a user is looking for a dessert that will match their "mood". the user creates an acct and then is redirected to the landing page. from the landing page, the user can then pick from 3 preselected emotions that will return specific recipes corresponding with the selected emotion. 

## Code Example

Schemas were set up for the different models being used. They were then populated and seeded to render the data I provided. Routes were then set up to implement full CRUD for the user, with the ability to add recipes coming in version 2.0. Bootstrap was used for styling

## Motivation

I wanted to create a fun and happy app. Plus being someone who loves dessert, I am always looking for a good recipe to try out.

## Installation

To run the code, fork and clone the repo and run npm init and then npm --i to download all of the packages necessary to launch. This project is hosted using heroku; After the packages have been installed and the repo is cloned, you may host the repo on heroku, given you have an acct with them. Mongo db was also used as the database

## Tests

While looking at the code, you will see several comments along the flow referencing what was being done. npm run start:dev is the command to connect the database. Once setting up the schemas and seeding your data (node seeds db.js) run this command to make sure that you are in fact connected to the database
